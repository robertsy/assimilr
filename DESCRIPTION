Description: Implementation of the EnKPF, block-LEnKPF and naive-LEnKPF.
    The code is not meant to be efficient but a rather literal implementation of
    the algorithms. An example of one step analysis is done with a simple Gaussian
    random field. Cycled experiments with the modified shallow water equation model of
    Wursch and Craig (2014) designed to mimick cumulus convection are conducted. The
    later is implemented in fortran90 for better performance.
